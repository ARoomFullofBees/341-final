I'm going to make the site about Homemaking and Witchcraft, building on other
sites I've done during our homework.
I'm adding several categories having to do with cooking, cleaning, gardening, and taking care of pets.
I might leave out some of the categories for the sake of simplicity. I'm going to use a font that is only
slightly stylistic, because a lot of similar sites use very complicated fonts to their detriment.

I'm making my About Me section with my professional psychic name, Lenore Vinka.
The home page ended up looking pretty great once I chose the stylistic elements.
The rest of the pages gave me some trouble, however. I was going to repurpose the
code from week 10, but it didn't look great, so I ended up really liking the other design
for all of the pages, because the content looked a lot better, even if it's not as varied, it
still looks like a good repetition with variation throughout.

I had a lot of tweeking to do putting the content in, but nothing was too challenging and frustrating this time, and I'm happy with the end result.
